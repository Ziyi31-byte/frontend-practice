# frontend-practice

a repo for javascript + react learning and practice from IT5007

1. branch a2 - assignment 2

The assignment asks students to build a peer-to-peer interview prep platform where students could upload and share interview questions. 

The assignment emphasizes on purely frontend basics, including html, css, basic CRUD, single page application, and local data persistence.

2. branch main - assignment 3

The assignment asks students to build a similar server with a2, but using more comprehensive full-stack technologies. 

The main goal is to develop two services: Question Service (QSV) and User service (USV). Both services have a need to support the CRUD operations (e.g. Creating questions, Creating new users). The technologies being used include React and Bootstrap in frontend, and MongoDB, Nodejs and GraphQL in backend. 

3. branch a4 - assignment 4

The assignment asks students to build a very simplified mobile service based on MERN stack textbook, as an introductory for students to understand React Native better.
